# Ensemble_energy_efficiency
A comparison of energy efficiencies of various implementations of ensemble learning

## Acknowledgement

## Datasets used:
The original iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), and modified iris datasets with data replicated 10 and 100 times respectively.
The work is also proposed using NSL-KDD dataset (https://github.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD).

## Measurement of metrics
We measured the temperature using [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/), a [free and open-source](https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor) software that monitors temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load and clock speeds of a computer.
